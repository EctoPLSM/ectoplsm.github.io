I am a 2nd year PhD student reading astronomy at the [Division of Science](https://sci.nao.ac.jp/main/en/), [National Astronomical Observatory of Japan](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/), advised by [Prof. Takashi J. Moriya](https://sci.nao.ac.jp/MEMBER/takashi.moriya/).
Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree from the [Department of Astronomy](https://www.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), where I was advised by [Prof. Toshikazu Shigeyama](https://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/getd/).

### Research Interests

My main interests are supernova explosions and the evolution of massive stars that lead up to them. I am currently working on theoretical modelling of supernovae interacting with their circumstellar environments, with a particular focus on their implications for stellar activity during a star's late-stage evolution. 

### Non-research Interests

I also like puzzles; Sudokus, crosswords, you get the idea. I even [obtained the title of "Global Brain King"](https://weibo.com/3865692567/O7iqc7H2G) by virtue of solving puzzles in a Chinese game show. Here are [some](https://ectoplsm.github.io/wpc-unofficial.org/) [resources](https://wpcunofficial.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) I made about the World Puzzle Championships, an annual logic puzzle competition in which I have previously participated, representing [Team Japan](http://jppuzzles.com/).
